# backtesting-lab-fe

## Core Project Goal:

### Short version:

To build the TradingView of Backtesting software

### Long version:

To create a comprehensive, user-friendly, and powerful desktop application for daytraders to backtest, analyze, refine, and develop trading models. It combines manual and automated elements, is privacy focused and the core version will be offered for free. The software will have a strong emphasis on a high-quality user experience and detailed analysis capabilities. The core premise of the software will be an iterative approach to trading model development.

## Important Note

Please note that this repository only contains the FE codebase (presentational UI) for BacktestingLab and the BE will not be open sourced.

This project is currently under development, so there will be temporary UI issues until the project is fully complete. If you try to run this repo locally, you may see the design and some basic functionality will work, but you will not be able to use the software as intended (for backtesting and developing your own trading models). You will have to wait until the launch of our desktop software to be able to use the full functionality of this software for its intended purpose.

If you are interested in being an early test user, please contact me through DM on X. Limited to 10 users (2/10 spaces filled)
